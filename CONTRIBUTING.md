Thank you for your interest in contributing to this research project!

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find bugs, inconsistencies, or have suggestions:

1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Create a new issue with:
   - Clear title describing the problem

### Improving Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome:

- Fix typos or unclear explanations
- Add examples or use cases
- Improve methodology descriptions

### Adding New Models or Datasets

If you want to extend the validation:

1. **New Models**: Follow the existing pattern in `4_Models.ipynb`
   - Use consistent hyperparameter documentation
   - Include training time measurements
   - Save models with descriptive names

2. **New Datasets**: 
   - Must be publicly available
   - Document source and access method
   - Explain relevance to cryptojacking detection

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to functions
- Comment complex logic
